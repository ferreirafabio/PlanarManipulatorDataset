# Planar Manipulator Dataset
The dataset consists of 90 000 color videos that show a planar robot manipulator executing articulated manipulation tasks. More precisely, the manipulator grasps a circular object of random color and size and places it on top of a square object/platform of again random color and size.
The initial conﬁgurations (location, size and color) of the objects were randomly sampled during generation. Different from other datasets such as the moving MNIST dataset, the samples comprise a goal-oriented task as described, making it more suitable for testing prediction capabilities of an ML model.For instance, one can use it as a toy dataset to investigate the capacity and output behavior of a deep neural network before testing it on real-world data. We have done this for a deep auto-encoder network:

# Specifications
We provide both the videos as .avi files as well as TensorFlow tfrecord files. The samples in the tfrecord files contain 10 frames of the original video which were taken equally distributed over the entire playtime. Here are some more details:
## Dataset as avi
- video resolution: 128x128
- fps: 30
- color depth: 24bpp (3 channels, RGB)
- video codec: ffmjpeg
- compression format: mjpeg, color encoding: yuvj420p

## Dataset as tfrecord
The tfrecord files have been created with the pip package ```video2tfrecord``` and each file contains 1000 videos. Due to the high computational cost of processing all original video frames in deep neural networks, we decided to reduce the number of extracted frames for the tfrecord files. As a result, every single tfrecord file entry consists of 10 RGB frames which were taken equally distributed over the video playtime. Assuming no prior knowledge about the video and its inherent scene dynamics, choosing frames equally spaced maximizes the chances of capturing most of the spatio-temporal dynamics. The video data is stored in a ```feature``` dict which is serialized as tf.train.Example and contains the following keys:
- feature[path] ('blob' + '/' + str(imageCount)
- feature['height']
- feature['width']
- feature['depth']
- feature['id']
